# Window snapper

Snap the front window to the left or right half, a wide side, or full screen with a keyboard shortcut, and move it to the next display. Replaces: Rectangle-style snapping on top of Windows' own Snap layouts, and the snapping part of PowerToys FancyZones. Ported from BAMA's window-snapper spec.

## Brief

# Snap

A tray app that moves and resizes the front window with keyboard shortcuts, for anyone who wants Rectangle's exact halves and wide sides on Windows.

## Replaces
Win+arrow snapping (which cycles through states and opens Snap assist), and FancyZones for people who only want halves and wide sides.

## Main jobs
1. Snap the front window to the left half, the right half, or full screen with a shortcut.
2. Snap it to a wide left or right side (two thirds by default), or send it to the next display.
3. Change any shortcut, the wide width, and the gap around windows in Settings.

## Data
- Shortcut: command, virtual key, modifiers. Stored in settings.json in %LOCALAPPDATA%\Snap.
- Layout: wide fraction (default 2/3), gap in epx (default 0). settings.json.
- Restore frame: window handle and its frame before the first snap. Memory only.

## Shape
Tray icon plus a Settings window, Windows 11 (Windows 10 19041 or later runs).
No taskbar button while only the tray icon runs. Local data. Works offline. No accounts.

## System hooks
Global shortcuts (RegisterHotKey), tray icon, launch at login (HKCU Run key).

## Reference
Rectangle, Magnet

## Look
Native Windows 11, Windows accent. Settings looks like Windows Settings: one card per shortcut with a layout glyph.

## Not in version one
- Drag a window to a screen edge to snap it (Windows does this already)
- Thirds, quarters, center
- A URL protocol and command line actions
```

Recipes: [global hotkey](../skills/code/os-integrations/recipes.md#global-hotkey-registerhotkey), [move a window](../skills/code/os-integrations/recipes.md#move-a-window), [tray icon](../skills/code/os-integrations/recipes.md#tray-icon), [launch at login](../skills/code/os-integrations/recipes.md#launch-at-login), [single instance](../skills/code/os-integrations/recipes.md#single-instance), [elevation](../skills/code/os-integrations/recipes.md#elevation-and-uipi).

Main types:

- `SnapCommand` (Core): enum of `Left`, `Right`, `Maximize`, `LeftWide`, `RightWide`, `NextDisplay`, `PreviousDisplay`, `Restore`.
- `Box` (Core): an integer rectangle in physical pixels, with `Intersect`, `Area`, `Right`, `Bottom`.
- `SnapLayout` (Core, not `Layout`, which WinUI already uses): pure functions that turn a command, a window frame, and a work area into a target frame. Unit tested.
- `KeyCombo` and `ShortcutMap` (Core): a virtual key plus modifiers, display text ("Ctrl+Alt+Left"), and the rule that one combo belongs to one command.
- `WindowManager` (app): picks the target window, reads its visible frame, applies the target, remembers Restore frames.
- `HotkeyCenter` (app): registers the saved shortcuts on a hidden window, keeps the ones that failed, can suspend and resume.
- `TrayIcon` (app): the icon, its menu, and the hidden window that receives both tray and hotkey messages.
- `ShortcutButton` (app): a button that records the next combo.

Default shortcuts: Left half Ctrl+Alt+Left, Right half Ctrl+Alt+Right, Maximize Ctrl+Alt+Enter, Left wide Ctrl+Alt+Down, Right wide Ctrl+Alt+Up, Next display Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Right, Previous display Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Left, Restore Ctrl+Alt+Backspace.

Behaviors that matter:

- **Which screen.** The monitor with the largest intersection of its full rect and the window's visible frame. Use its `rcWork` as the area, so the taskbar stays clear.
- **Halves.** Left: `x = area.X`, `width = area.Width / 2`, full height. Right: `x = area.X + area.Width / 2`, the rest of the width. Maximize: the whole area, as a normal window, not the maximized state.
- **Wide.** One setting, not a cycle: two thirds (default), three quarters, or five sixths. Clamp to 0.5 to 0.9. Left wide starts at `area.X`; Right wide ends at `area.Right`. Settings titles show the fraction: "Left wide (3/4)".
- **Gap.** 0 to 40 epx in steps of 2, default 0, scaled by the target monitor's DPI. A full gap on a side that touches the area edge, half a gap on a side that meets a neighbour. Two halves then have one full gap between them.
- **Next and previous display.** Sort monitors by `(X, Y)` and wrap around. Keep the relative position and size: scale x, y, width, and height by the ratio of the two work areas, then intersect with the new area. If that is empty, use the whole new area. With one display, do nothing.
- **Restore.** Before the first snap of a window, store its visible frame under its handle. Later snaps keep the first one. Restore puts it back and forgets it. No stored frame: beep.
- **Target window.** The foreground window, unless it is Snap's own window, the taskbar (`Shell_TrayWnd`), or the desktop (`Progman`, `WorkerW`). Then use the last other top-level window, tracked with `EVENT_SYSTEM_FOREGROUND`. A tray menu click makes Snap the foreground app, so the tray menu always uses the tracked window.
- **Failure.** No window, a minimized window, or a window `SetWindowPos` refuses (an elevated app): `MessageBeep(MB_OK)` and nothing else.
- **Check and retry.** After setting the frame, read the visible frame back. If it is more than 2 px off, set it again after 80 ms. If the window is still larger than the target (an app with a minimum size), keep it inside the screen against the edge it was sent to: right-side commands align its right edge, all commands align its top.
- **Shortcut rules.** One combo belongs to one command: setting it removes it from any other command. A combo needs Ctrl, Alt, or Win, except F1 to F12. Shift alone is not enough.

Windows draws an invisible resize border around most windows (7 px at 100% on the left, right, and bottom). `GetWindowRect` includes it; what people see is `DWMWA_EXTENDED_FRAME_BOUNDS`. Work in visible frames, and convert at the last step:

```csharp
// The rect SetWindowPos needs so the visible frame lands on target.
static Box OuterFor(Box target, Box outer, Box visible) => new(
    target.X - (visible.X - outer.X),
    target.Y - (visible.Y - outer.Y),
    target.Width + (outer.Width - visible.Width),
    target.Height + (outer.Height - visible.Height));
```

## Gotchas

- `GetWindowRect` includes an invisible resize border, about 7 px at 100% on the left, right, and bottom. Snap with it and every window has a visible gap at the left edge and hangs 7 px off the bottom. Work in `DWMWA_EXTENDED_FRAME_BOUNDS` and add the border back for `SetWindowPos`.
- Declare the process PerMonitorV2 DPI aware (the template's `app.manifest` does). Without it, Windows scales coordinates for you and halves land in the wrong place on a 150% display.
- A maximized window ignores `SetWindowPos` sizes and keeps its maximized state. `ShowWindow(SW_RESTORE)` first, then move.
- Windows refuses `SetWindowPos` on a window of an elevated app when Snap is not elevated (UIPI). The call returns false with `ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED`. Beep and say why; never ask the user to run Snap as administrator.
- Ctrl+Alt+arrow keys rotate the screen on some PCs with old Intel graphics drivers, and the driver takes the combo first. `RegisterHotKey` then fails. Show the failure on the card so the user can pick another combo.
- `RegisterHotKey` fails when another app owns the combo, and nothing else tells you. Keep the result of every call and show failures in Settings.
- Win+arrow keys belong to Windows Snap. `RegisterHotKey` with `MOD_WIN` and an arrow fails or fights with the shell. Use Ctrl+Alt.
- The recorder never sees a combo that is still registered: Windows delivers it as `WM_HOTKEY` instead of a key press. Unregister every hotkey while recording, register again when done.
- A WinUI app exits when its last window closes. Set `DispatcherShutdownMode = DispatcherShutdownMode.OnExplicitShutdown` and hide the Settings window on close (`AppWindow.Closing`, `args.Cancel = true`, `AppWindow.Hide()`), or the tray app dies when Settings closes.
- The tray menu needs `SetForegroundWindow` on the hidden window before `TrackPopupMenuEx`, or it never closes when you click elsewhere. That makes Snap the foreground app, so menu commands must use the window tracked before, not `GetForegroundWindow`.
- After Explorer restarts, the tray icon is gone. Listen for the `TaskbarCreated` message (`RegisterWindowMessage`) on a hidden top-level window, not a message-only window, which never gets broadcasts, and add the icon again.
- A test run must not join the running copy. Single-instance redirection skips itself when `APP_STORE` is set, and the self-test unregisters its hotkeys before exit, so a running Snap keeps its shortcuts.
- `RegisterHotKey` with a null window handle also succeeds, and then `WM_HOTKEY` goes to the thread queue where WinUI never shows it to you: every shortcut is dead with no error. Register on the hidden tray window, and have the self-test check the handle and post a `WM_HOTKEY` to it.
- An agent cannot prove a real key press from its sandboxed shell: injected keys may never reach the hotkey system. The self-test posts `WM_HOTKEY` to the tray window instead, aimed at its own test window, and the physical key press stays a `[manual]` line.
- Some apps (terminals, Steam) snap their size to a character grid or a minimum. After the retry, check the size and pin the window to the edge it was sent to.
- Name the code `Snap`, never `Windows`. Built as one feature of a larger app, a folder and namespace like `MyApp.Features.Windows` shadows the WinRT `Windows.*` root in every sibling `MyApp.Features.*` namespace: `Windows.Foundation.Point` fails with CS0234 in every other feature, and each one needs `global::Windows...`.

Done when every default shortcut snaps the foreground window of any normal app to the right frame on each connected display, a failed shortcut shows in Settings, Settings changes every shortcut, the wide width, and the gap, and Snap keeps running in the tray after Settings closes.
