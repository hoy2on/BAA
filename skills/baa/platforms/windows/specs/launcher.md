# Launcher

Press Alt+Space, type a few letters, press Enter: the app, file, or web
search opens. Replaces: PowerToys Run, the Start menu search box, and
Everything for finding files by name. Ported from BAMA's launcher spec.

## Brief

```markdown
# Launch

A keyboard launcher for one person: press a shortcut, type, and open an app, a file, or a web search.

## Replaces
PowerToys Run and Start menu search, for opening apps and files.

## Main jobs
1. Open an app by typing part of its name or its initials ("vsc" for Visual Studio Code).
2. Find a file or folder by name, then open it or show it in File Explorer.
3. Run a keyword search: "g cats" searches Google, "code" lists workspace files.

## Data
- AppEntry: name, launch target (shortcut path or AppUserModelID), folded name, initials
  (rebuilt on every open, not saved)
- QuickSearch: keyword, name, kind (files or website), extensions, url with {query}, app path, enabled
- Usage: open count per target, and the last target picked for each query
- Launch.db (SQLite) and settings.json in %LOCALAPPDATA%\Launch

## Shape
Borderless, topmost panel opened with a global shortcut, a tray icon, and a Settings window.
Windows 11 first, Windows 10 19041 or later still runs. No taskbar button for the panel.
Local data. Works offline. No accounts.

## System hooks
Global shortcut (default Alt+Space), tray icon, Windows Search index for files.

## Reference
PowerToys Run, Start menu search

## Look
Native Fluent. One acrylic panel with rounded corners: the search box on top, results
below, the accent color on the selected row. Results never animate.

## Not in version one
- Calculator and Settings pages (ms-settings: links)
- Clipboard history, snippets, workflows, plugins
- GIF search and developer project search
```

## How it works

| Part | API | Permission |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Global shortcut | `RegisterHotKey` with `MOD_ALT \| MOD_NOREPEAT` and `VK_SPACE`, on the tray icon's window | None |
| Panel | WinUI `Window`, `OverlappedPresenter.SetBorderAndTitleBar(true, false)`, `IsAlwaysOnTop`, `AppWindow.IsShownInSwitchers = false`, `DesktopAcrylicBackdrop` | None |
| Desktop apps | `.lnk` files under `%ProgramData%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs` and `%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs` | None |
| Packaged apps (Calculator, Terminal, Settings) | `PackageManager.FindPackagesForUser("")` (works unpackaged, about 1 s, so in the background), `Package.GetAppListEntriesAsync()`; open with `shell:AppsFolder\<AUMID>` through `Process.Start` with `UseShellExecute`, so no `AppListEntry` is kept | None |
| File search | Windows Search through `System.Data.OleDb`: provider `Search.CollatorDSO`, `SELECT ... FROM SystemIndex` | None (the Windows Search service must run) |
| Icons | `StorageFile.GetThumbnailAsync(ThumbnailMode.SingleItem, 64)`, else `SHDefExtractIconW` on the exe; `AppListEntry.DisplayInfo.GetLogo` for packaged apps | None |
| Open, reveal | `Process.Start` with `UseShellExecute = true`; `explorer.exe /select,"<path>"` | None |
| Give focus back | `GetForegroundWindow` before showing, `SetForegroundWindow` on Esc | None |
| Tray icon | `Shell_NotifyIcon`, `TrackPopupMenuEx` | None |

Launch needs no permission. The failure states are a shortcut that another
app already owns and a stopped Windows Search service. Recipes:
[global hotkey](../skills/code/os-integrations/recipes.md#global-hotkey-registerhotkey),
[tray icon](../skills/code/os-integrations/recipes.md#tray-icon),
[single instance](../skills/code/os-integrations/recipes.md#single-instance).

Types to create:

- `HotkeyCenter` and `KeyCombo`: register the shortcut, record failures, suspend while recording.
- `LauncherWindow`: the panel, `PreviewKeyDown` on the search box, `Present()` and `Hide()`.
- `LauncherModel` (`ObservableObject`): Query, Results, Selection, generation; `Search()` and `Activate()`. Opening a target and the file query are delegates, so self-tests never start another app and never depend on the index.
- `FuzzyMatch` (Core): pure static class with `Fold`, `Initials`, `Score`. Unit tested.
- `AppIndex`, `FileSearch`, `QuickSearchStore` and `UsageStore` (SQLite, Core), `IconCache`.
- `SettingsPage`, `ShortcutRecorder`, `TrayIcon`.
- Snapshot mode (`APP_SNAPSHOT`) also renders the panel with seeded results as pages `launcher-empty` and `launcher-results`.

Fuzzy score: fold query and name (`Normalize(NormalizationForm.FormD)`, drop
`UnicodeCategory.NonSpacingMark`, `ToLowerInvariant()`),
`penalty = Math.Min(name.Length, 60)`, higher is better, null is no match. Exact
name 1000. Name prefix 900, initials prefix 800, word prefix 700, substring 500,
each minus penalty. Letters in order: `Math.Max(1, 300 - gaps * 8 - penalty)`,
gaps = skipped characters.

Initials: the first letter of each word, plus each capital after a lowercase letter:

```csharp
var result = new StringBuilder();
var previous = ' ';
foreach (var c in s)
{
    var word = char.IsLetterOrDigit(c);
    var prevWord = char.IsLetterOrDigit(previous);
    if (word && (!prevWord || (char.IsUpper(c) && char.IsLower(previous)))) result.Append(c);
    previous = c;
}
return Fold(result.ToString());   // "Visual Studio Code" -> "vsc", "WebStorm" -> "ws"
```

Ranking and limits:

- App score = fuzzy score + `Math.Min(200, opens * 20)` + 300 when this app was the last pick for this exact query.
- Keep the top 6 apps. When the best app scores 500 or more, hide apps under 450.
- Order: apps, then quick search hint rows, then files, then one "Search Google" row last. An app wins a tie; equal scores of the same kind sort by name.
- Desktop apps: every `.lnk` in both Start menu folders and their subfolders, named by the file name without `.lnk`. Drop names that start with "Uninstall". Add File Explorer (`explorer.exe`) when no shortcut has that name. Rescan on every open, on a background thread.
- Packaged apps: read at launch, and again in the background on each open; show the last list meanwhile. Skip framework and resource packages. Drop duplicate names; a desktop shortcut wins.
- Files: only when the query has 2 or more characters. Wait 80 ms after the last key, then run the query on a background thread.
- File query: one `CONTAINS(System.FileName, '"word*"')` per word, joined with `AND`, plus `System.FileExtension <> '.lnk'`. Double every `'`, strip `"` and `*`. Scope: one `SCOPE='file:<folder>'` per folder in Settings, joined with `OR`, default the user folder. `SELECT TOP 80 System.ItemPathDisplay`.
- Drop paths containing `\node_modules\`, `\.git\`, `\AppData\`, `\bin\`, `\obj\`, `\site-packages\`, `\.venv\`. Score by file name plus usage, keep 12. `\AppData\` also drops `%TEMP%` (`AppData\Local\Temp`), so a self-test cannot seed a file result there: it fakes the file query instead.
- App subtitle: "Application" for a desktop app, "App" for a packaged one. A Start menu shortcut path says nothing to the person.
- File subtitle: the last three folders, the user folder as `~`: "… › Projects › app › src".
- Quick search: "keyword rest" where the keyword matches an enabled, ready search. Ready means a keyword without spaces, and at least one extension (files) or a url with `{query}` (website). Defaults: `code` (files, `code-workspace`), `g` Google, `yt` YouTube, `gh` GitHub.
- Website kind: one row that opens the url with `Uri.EscapeDataString(text)`. Files kind: `System.FileExtension = '.ext'` for each extension (joined with `OR`), plus `System.FileName LIKE '%word%'` per word. `TOP 400`, `ORDER BY System.DateModified DESC`, show 60. Opens in the chosen app (`Process.Start(appPath, "\"" + path + "\"")`), or the default app.
- Hints: with no space typed, each keyword that starts with the query shows a hint row. An exact keyword goes on top. Enter or Tab on a hint fills in "keyword ".
- Keys: Up, Down, Enter opens, Ctrl+Enter shows it in File Explorer, Ctrl+1 to 9 opens that row, Tab completes, Esc closes. The panel closes when it loses activation (a click outside).
- Usage: on open, `opens[target] += 1` and `learned[foldedQuery] = target`, in Launch.db.
- Panel: 700 epx wide, search box 56 epx, rows 48 epx, up to 8 rows then scroll. The top sits 18% below the top of the work area of the monitor with the pointer. The panel takes focus; it saves the foreground window first and gives focus back to it on Esc.

# Stories

## M1 Core loop

### S-001 Open the launcher with the shortcut
As the user, I press Alt+Space in any app and the search panel appears.
Screens: launcher-empty
Acceptance:
- [snap] An acrylic panel with "Search apps and files" sits 18% below the top of the screen.
- [manual] The search box has focus and I can type at once.
- [manual] Esc, a click outside, or Alt+Space again closes it, and focus goes back to the app I came from.
Status: todo

### S-002 Find an app by name or initials
As the user, I type "calc" or "vsc" and the matching app is the first row.
Screens: launcher-results
Depends: S-001
Acceptance:
- [unit] FuzzyMatch scores exact > prefix > initials > word prefix > substring > letters in order.
- [unit] Initials("Visual Studio Code") is "vsc"; "cafe" matches "Café".
- [snap] Rows show icon, name, a subtitle ("Application" or "App" for apps, the folders for files), and Ctrl+1 to 9 key caps; the last row is "Search Google".
- [self] Typing "calc" into the panel's search box puts Calculator first. Opening goes to a recording delegate, so no app starts.
Status: todo

### S-003 Open, reveal, or search the web
As the user, I pick a row with the arrow keys or Ctrl+N and press Enter or Ctrl+Enter.
Screens: launcher-results
Depends: S-002
Acceptance:
- [manual] Enter opens the app or file and the panel closes; Ctrl+Enter shows it selected in File Explorer.
- [manual] Calculator, a packaged app, opens from its row.
- [manual] The "Search Google" row opens the browser; spaces and & in the query survive.
- [manual] Hovering a row selects it only after the mouse really moves.
Status: todo

### S-004 Learn from what I open
As the user, the app I picked for "s" last time is first the next time I type "s".
Depends: S-003
Acceptance:
- [unit] Opening adds Math.Min(200, opens * 20); the last pick for the exact query adds 300.
- [self] Usage survives a restart.
Status: todo

### S-005 Find files by name
As the user, I type part of a file name and files show up under the apps.
Screens: launcher-files
Depends: S-002
Acceptance:
- [manual] Files appear within about 150 ms, between apps and the web row; rows above them do not move.
- [unit] Paths in node_modules, .git, AppData, bin, obj, site-packages, .venv are dropped.
- [self] With the file query faked to return a made-up path outside AppData, its row shows between the apps and the web row.
- [snap] The subtitle shows the last three folders, the user folder as ~.
- [manual] With the Windows Search service stopped, a row says "File search needs Windows Search" and apps still show.
Status: todo

### S-006 Use the tray icon
As the user, I right-click the tray icon and see Open Launch (with its shortcut), Settings, and Quit.
Acceptance:
- [unit] The menu model shows the current shortcut next to "Open Launch".
- [manual] A left click opens the launcher. No taskbar button while only the tray icon runs; closing Settings keeps the app running.
Status: todo

### S-007 Change the shortcut, and see when it is taken
As the user, I click the recorder in Settings and press a new combo.
Screens: settings-general
Acceptance:
- [manual] All shortcuts pause while recording. Esc cancels, Backspace clears, a combo without Ctrl, Alt, or Win (and not an F-key) is refused.
- [manual] When RegisterHotKey fails (PowerToys Run holds Alt+Space), an orange warning shows next to the shortcut.
Status: todo

## M2 Keyword searches

### S-008 Search a website with a keyword
As the user, I type "yt cats" and Enter opens YouTube results for cats.
Screens: launcher-quick-web
Acceptance:
- [snap] The search box shows a "YouTube" chip and a single row.
- [unit] Match("yt cats") returns YouTube and "cats"; disabled or not-ready searches never match.
- [manual] Typing "y" shows a YouTube hint row; Tab or Enter fills in "yt ".
Status: todo

### S-009 List files with a keyword
As the user, I type "code " and see my .code-workspace files, newest first.
Screens: launcher-quick-files
Depends: S-008
Acceptance:
- [manual] More words narrow the list; Enter opens the file in the chosen app.
- [snap] An empty result shows "No code workspaces found".
Status: todo

### S-010 Edit quick searches in Settings
As the user, I add, edit, turn off, and delete keyword searches.
Screens: settings-quick-searches
Depends: S-008

- [self] Quick searches survive a restart (Launch.db).
Status: todo

### S-011 Choose what and where to search
As the user, I turn apps, files, and the web row on or off, and pick the folders for file search.
Screens: settings-search
Acceptance:
- [manual] The last folder cannot be removed; a new folder is used on the next search.
- [snap] The footer says only folders in the Windows Search index show up, with a link to Indexing options.
Status: todo

## Dropped
- GIF search (needs an outside API key), developer projects, and text transforms (json, b64, jwt).
- Custom shell commands, port and process commands.
- Calculator row and Settings pages (good M3 candidates).
- "find" and "open" file-only keywords, URL protocol, activity stats.
```

## Gotchas

- A window with `WS_EX_NOACTIVATE` never gets keyboard focus, so a TextBox in it cannot be typed into. The launcher panel activates. Save `GetForegroundWindow()` before showing it, and on Esc hide it and call `SetForegroundWindow` on the saved window.
- `Activate()` from the hotkey handler can leave the panel behind the app in front with a flashing taskbar button, and typing then goes to the other app. Check `GetForegroundWindow()` after `Activate()` and call `Win32.ForceForeground` when it is not the panel.
- Set focus to the search box in the window's `Activated` handler, not before the show. Focus set on a hidden window is lost.
- A plain `TextBox` on acrylic turns white when focused. For a bare search field, override `TextControlBackground`, `TextControlBackgroundPointerOver`, `TextControlBackgroundFocused`, and the matching `TextControlBorderBrush` keys in `TextBox.Resources`.
- WinUI raises `TextChanged` after `Text` is set, not during. Code that sets `Text` and reads the rows at once (a self-test, a hint that fills in "yt ") sees the old rows, and the late event then searches again. Search directly when code sets the text, and skip the event when the text equals the last query.
- The panel hides when it loses activation, and parallel test runs share one foreground. Self-tests turn hide on deactivate off while they run.
- The TextBox handles Up, Down, and Tab itself. Handle them in `PreviewKeyDown` on the TextBox and set `Handled`; by `KeyDown`, Tab has already moved focus.
- The first press built the window and its XAML tree, and the panel came up late. Build it 2 s after launch, show it off screen with `AppWindow.Show(false)`, let it draw one frame, and hide it.
- Files arrive later than apps. Insert them between the instant rows and the web row, and keep the selection by row id if the user already moved. Bump a generation counter on every search and drop any async result from an older one.
- Rows that change under a still mouse fire `PointerEntered` and steal the selection. Select on hover only when `GetCursorPos` changed since the last search.
- Alt+Space opens the window menu of the app in front. Launch takes it over on purpose, like PowerToys Run. The window menu stays one right-click on the title bar away. When PowerToys Run is running, the call fails and the warning shows.
- A typed `'` broke the SQL of the Windows Search query. Double every `'`, strip `"` and `*`. Folders outside the index never show up, so say that in the folder setting's footer.
- When the Windows Search service is stopped or disabled, `OleDbConnection.Open()` throws. Catch it, show one row that says so, and keep the app results.
- The index holds `.venv\Lib\site-packages` and `node_modules` folders under the user folder. Without the path filter they fill all 12 file rows.
- Calculator, Terminal, and Settings have no `.lnk` in the Start menu folders. Read packaged apps through `PackageManager`. That call is slow, so cache the list and refresh it in the background.
- Icons from `GetThumbnailAsync` are async shell work. Ask for 64 px once, show them at 32 epx, and keep them in a cache keyed by path, bounded to the current app list. It throws `COMException` for `C:\Windows\explorer.exe` and `System32\cmd.exe` on Windows 11: fall back to `SHDefExtractIconW` and copy the HICON's bitmap into a `WriteableBitmap`.
- On two monitors at different scales, the hidden panel has the DPI of the monitor it was on last. Size it with `GetDpiForMonitor` for the monitor under the pointer, then move it.
- Resizing the panel for each row made it jump. Resize once per finished search, with the top edge fixed, and only when the row count changed.
- A second copy fails `RegisterHotKey` with `ERROR_HOTKEY_ALREADY_REGISTERED` and shows a false "taken" warning. Make the app single instance (`AppInstance.FindOrRegisterForKey`) and send the second launch to the first copy's Settings.
- Closing the Settings window must not end the app. Cancel `AppWindow.Closing` and call `AppWindow.Hide()`. Show Settings only from the tray, a second launch, or the agent modes (`APP_SNAPSHOT`, `--selftest`).
- Changed from BAMA: the search box is 56 epx and rows are 48 epx, to sit on BAWA's 4 epx grid. The 60 pt shadow margin and the fixed transparent window are gone, because DWM draws the shadow outside a bordered WinUI window.

Done when Alt+Space opens the panel over any app, "vsc" or "calc" puts the right app first and Enter opens it, a file in the user folder shows up and opens, "yt cats" opens YouTube, and usage survives a restart.
